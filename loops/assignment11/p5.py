"""5. Harshad Number Checker

A number scanner is installed in a research laboratory 
where thousands of numeric access codes are tested every 
day. To identify mathematically balanced codes, 
the system checks whether the entered number qualifies
 as a Harshad number. Numbers passing this test are 
 considered valid for the next stage of processing.

A Harshad number is a number that is exactly divisible
 by the sum of its digits.

Example:
18 → 1 + 8 = 9 and 18 ÷ 9 = 2

Write a program using loops to check whether 
the entered number is a Harshad number.

Input:
18

Output:
Harshad Number
