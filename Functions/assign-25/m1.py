# Assignment 1: Smart Street Lights (Fibonacci Series)

# A smart city installs street lights in a newly developed area. The number of lights installed each month follows the Fibonacci pattern.

# Month 1 → 0 lights
# Month 2 → 1 light
# Every following month, the number of lights installed is the sum of the previous two months.

# As a software developer, your task is to help the city planning department generate the installation schedule.

# Task

# Write a recursive function to print the first N Fibonacci numbers.

# Input
# Enter the number of months:
# 7
# Output
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
# n =int(input("Enter the number of months:"))
# def fibo(n):
#     if n == 0 or n==1:
#          return n 

#     return fibo(n-1)+fibo(n-2)


# for i in range(n):
#     print(fibo(i))

# ~~~~~~~~~~~
def fibonacci(n,a=0,b=1):
    if n == 0:
        return 
    print(a,end=" ")
    fibonacci(n-1,b,a+b)
n = int(input("Enter the Number: "))
